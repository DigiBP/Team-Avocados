## Introduction
Smart Avocs, a dynamic and innovative legal solutions provider, has recognized the need to enhance its HR recruitment processes through digitalization. With a focus on attracting top legal talent, streamlining the candidate experience, and optimizing resource allocation, the company aims to leverage digital tools and technologies to expedite the hiring process and ensure a fair and unbiased selection process. 

## As-Is-Process
Businesses must prioritize quality, high standards, and innovation across all facets of their operations if they want to succeed. The hiring of outstanding individuals is a key component that contributes to these attributes. Within the organization, the hiring process plays a strategic function that necessitates a thorough review of the candidate's profile while assuring alignment with the overall strategy, vision, and long-term objectives of the business. The importance of developing a strong hiring procedure that successfully spots and recruits top people that can contribute to the company's success and personify its fundamental values is highlighted in this abstract.

Numerous manual stages are currently involved in the Smart Avocs HR recruitment process, which presents a number of difficulties and constraints. First off, relying on manual processes creates a labor- and time-intensive process. It takes a lot of time and effort for HR employees to manually execute operations like posting jobs, screening resumes, and candidate evaluation.

Additionally, the manual nature of the process increases the possibility of mistakes and discrepancies. When numerous people are involved in different stages of recruiting, there is a higher chance of misunderstandings, data entry errors, and the opportunity to miss qualified candidates. These mistakes might result in missed opportunities and make it more difficult to find the people who are most fit for the organization.
